Users learned or claiming to speak that language may be asked to populate these phrases. e.g. Anyone learning any language should be able to say, "Listen to my friend here" in that language, or, "I'd like a coffee," and so on. So we should create these links between phrases of other languages, and then interfaces for users to be prompted about these phrases.
